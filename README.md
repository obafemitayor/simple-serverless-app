# Simple Serverless App Built WIth Node.js & AWS Lambda

## Setting up the project locally

To set up the project locally, do the following:

1. Install and execute [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Run `npm install` on the root of the project folder to install the dependencies.
3. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up` on the root of the project to start the database.
4. Run the migrations by executing `db-migrate up initialize` (you can rollback the migration by running `db-migrate down`).
5. Move the `migrations folder`, the `seed folder` and the `database.json` file to the root directory, if you get an error while executing the above and then try the migration commands again.
6. Run `npm start` to start the example server

## Deploying application to AWS

To deploy the application to AWS Lambda Service, do the following:

# On the serverless.yml file, do this:

1. Change `${AWS::AccountId}` to AWS AccountID and change `${AWS::Region}` to AWS region.
2. Change `onError: arn:aws:sns:eu-central-1:900989174731:dlq-topic` to `onError: arn:aws:sns:[aws region]:[aws accountid]:dlq-topic`.
3. Change `${your host ip on prod}` to PostgreSQL Database Host IP for production, $`{your host port on prod}` to port on production, `${your host user on prod}` to username on production, `${your host user password on prod}` to password on production.
4. Change `${your host ip on dev}` to PostgreSQL Database Host IP for development, `${your host port on dev}` to port on development, `${your host user on dev}` to username on development, `${your host user password on dev}` to password on development.

# Do the following after the above

1. Run `tsc --build` to transpile the Typescript code to Javascript code. AWS Lambda can only run javascript code so the ts code needs to be converted to js.
2. Run `serverless deploy` to deploy all functions and dependencies to AWS.
3. If there is a deployment skip message and functions are not being deployed, then run `serverless deploy --stage dev --force` to do a force deployment.


## Environment Variables Definition

1. QUNO_DB_CONN_PROD: connection details for PostgreSQL database on production environment
2. QUNO_DB_CONN_TEST: connection details for PostgreSQL database on dev environment
3. QUNO_SCORE_MAPPING: object representing mapping that will be used to determine `qunoscoreText` of every doctor on the platform
4. QUNOENV: test: current environment of the application. 


## Running Tests

1. Set up Environment Variables from above on local machine or server. This is important for all tests to pass
1. Run `jest index.unit.test` to run all unit tests.
2. Run `jest index.integration.test` to run all integration tests.

## Functions

1. The postdoctor function accepts a JSON object describing the new doctor and returns a HTTP 202 response which signals that the request has been
   recieved for processing. This request is then forwarded to an SNS queue that would be treated by another function

2. The getDoctors function if successful returns a HTTP status code 200 and a list of paginated doctors either in descending or ascending order.
   The function also returns a particular doctor if an Id is present in the request.

3. The createDoctor functions is triggered when the postdoctor function publishes a message to a topic in SNS. This is the function that creates the record in the database.

I used an asynchronous approach to ensure that the postdoctor endpoint returns a response in less than 300ms. I acheived this using a pub/sub design pattern implemented with AWS SNS.
